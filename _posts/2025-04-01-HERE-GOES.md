A wise person once said "The best time to start a blog was 20 years ago, the next best time is today". I forget who it was, and maybe it was about something else, but you get the point. I am starting a blog. Why? Well, I like lots of stuff and I want to talk about it with people who also like that stuff. It's mostly techy stuff, like programming language, data science, linux, etc. But, I also like reading, writing, cooking, film, hiking, thrift-stores, cycling, kayaking, building things... Oh, and also being a grandfather! I am actually an urban transportation planner by profession, and all of those plannery things still interest me, but I've been doing that for over 30 years and I want to lean into my hobbies. So, where will this lead? I have no clue.
